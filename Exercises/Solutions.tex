\subsection*{a) Generalized velocity}
It would be prone to error to make simulations with would work with value to the order or $10^{-11}$, for the gravitational constant, and values of order $10^{+11}$, one astronomical unit. Therefore before anything is done, space will be rescaled by $1AU$ and time by one year ($1Y$), as follows.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
    r \rightarrow &R=\frac{r}{1AU}\\
    t \rightarrow &T=\frac{t}{1Y}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

With this, the gravitational acceleration formula can be rewritten

\begin{align*}
  \frac{d^2r}{dt^2} &= - \frac{GM}{r^3}\hat{r}\\
  \frac{d^2R}{dT^2} &= - \frac{(1Y)^2}{(1AU)^3}\frac{GM}{R^3}\hat{R}\\
  \frac{d^2R}{dT^2} &= - \Gamma\frac{GM}{R^3}\hat{R}
\end{align*}
With $\Gamma\approx39,39$. The position, velocity, and acceleration of the Verlet algorithm (eqs. (118), (119) from the lecture notes) can be generalized to 2D as follows
\begin{align*}
  &\begin{cases}
    \vec{x}=(x,y)\\
    \vec{v}=(v_x,v_y)\\
    \vec{a}=(a_x,a_y)\\
  \end{cases}\\
  &\begin{cases}
    a_x&= -\Gamma \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}^3}\\
    a_y&= -\Gamma \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}^3}
  \end{cases}\\
\end{align*}
These positions and velocities are all rescaled as indicated above, meaning that the initial conditions are as follows $\vec{x}(t=0)=(35.2,0)$ and $\vec{v}(t=0)=(0,0.1920952)$

\subsection*{b)}
Simulation implemented in jupyter notebook, $dt=0.01$ (equivalent to $3.6$ days). When trying $dt=0.1$ accumulated error was too big and comet wasn't in orbit for more than 1 period.
